# Note: All code, insights shared, and methodological notes in this document and other documents in this portfolio ARE NOT open source and MUST be cited.

# For this page, I create 3 sets of paired faceted choropleth maps of Darfur, Sudan based on the average number of troops (derived from the Geo-PKO dataset) stationed at UN bases from the UNAMID peacekeeping mission in second level administrative regions. These administrative units are colored in the maps based on the average number of UN troops stationed in the regions during a given year. The location of recently closed down UN bases (also based on the Geo-PKO dataset) are plotted with blue dots. The maps will also show the location of attacks on civilians and fatality numbers from these attacks (plotted on the maps with transparent red bubbles) as recorded in the ACLED dataset. I will create union buffers (having radii of 50 mi) around bases that were abandoned by the UN, and calculate inside these union buffers the number of attacks on civilians and fatalities the year before the bases were closed vs. the year they were closed.

# The UN bases (also known as "team sites") withdrawn from West Darfur included the Forobaranga and Habila bases in 2017 Masteri and Mournei in 2018, and the El Geneina base in 2019. See the following sources I relied on for UN base closure dates:

# https://oios.un.org/file/8866/download?token=F6tc9ZI5 (pg. 31) - documents sites closed from 2017-2019 (I consider "team sites" and "section headquarters" as UN bases since troops are normally stationed at these types of compounds)
# https://www.ecoi.net/en/file/local/2052225/S_2021_470_E.pdf (pg. 24) - documents sites closed in 2021

# Note: No UN bases were closed in 2020, but were closed in 2021.

# I therefore create 3 sets of paired faceted maps: one comparing attacks on civilians and fatalities within 50 mi from the Forobaranga and Habila bases in 2016 vs. 2017, one that does the same within 50 mi of the Masteri and Mournei bases in 2017 vs. 2018, and another that does the same within 50 mi of the El Geneina base in 2018 vs. 2019. However, no bases in West Darfur were withdrawn after 2019, so I do not create faceted maps comparing West Darfur violence in 2019 vs. 2020 or in 2020 vs. 2021. Nevertheless, I later calculate numbers of attacks on civilians and fatalities each year from 2016-2021 inside the union buffers surrounding the UN bases withdrawn in 2017, 2018, and 2019 for a quantitative analysis of violence trends.

# Below, I start by reading in my Darfur map shapefile comprising second level administrative units, the ACLED dataset on violence against civilians comprising locations of attacks on civilians and fatalities resulting from these attacks, and the Geo-PKO dataset's variables on active UN base locations and troop numbers reported at each base on multiple occasions each year. For this last dataset, I create a variable showing the average number of troops stationed at each active UN base during a given year.

# Note: The sources listed above which provide accurate dates of UN base closures in Darfur enabled me to correctly edit some of the bases in the Geo-PKO dataset which incorrectly showed as being active in Darfur after they had in reality already been closed.

# After reading in the datasets, I convert them to "simple feature" (sf) spatial objects that will later be used to plot faceted tmap choropleth maps showing yearly differences in UN troop numbers from active UN bases across second level administrative units, and locations of attacks on civilians and fatalities. However, before mapping occurs, I must spatially join part of the ACLED violence against civilians dataset per year to the Darfur map, and the Geo-PKO dataset locations of active UN bases and average troop numbers per year to the Darfur map.

# I will be using a Projected Coordinate Reference System (PCRS) when creating maps and when making union buffer-based calculations within a 50 mi radius of closed UN base locations on these maps. The choice of whether to use a PCRS or a Geographic Coordinate Reference System (GCRS) is based on the following criteria:

# PCRSs are often better to use than Geographic Coordinate Reference Systems (GCRSs) when mapping or computing calculations from maps at the country-level, state/province/regional level, or city level because PCRSs are localized to a particular geographic region to minimize measurement distortions. A PCRS typically will only work well for measurements of distances or areas for the specific geographic location it was designed for rather than the entire globe. PCRSs are based on a plane, which results from a spheroid projected onto a 2D surface, and utilize linear units (feet, meters, etc.) for expressing coordinates.

# In contrast, GCRSs span the entire globe (e.g., longitude and latitude) and are based on a spheroid. They use angular units (degrees) for expressing coordinates. If you need to represent locations across the entire globe (like for a world map), then a Geographic CRS would be more appropriate because doing so with a PCRS may create distorted maps and measurements at this level. 

# Since I focus on the Darfur region within Sudan, it is better to use a PCRS. For making my maps and my union buffer-based calculations on these maps, I will use the PCRS - EPSG:20135 - a version of the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) system. However, I will first use a GCRS when converting objects to sf spatial objects - specifically EPSG:4326, also known as the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). I use this GCRS since the Darfur polygon map shapefile I will be using is based on this, and since it is generally good practice to use a GCRS before transforming spatial objects to a localized PCRS.

# The reason this is often considered good practice is because geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) are the most common form of spatial reference we usually encounter in objects before they are converted to sf format. Starting with these geographic coordinates, GCRS ensures you are working with the most raw, untransformed version of your data. This can help prevent the introduction of errors or distortions that might occur during the projection process.

# Why use EPSG:20135 (also known as the Adindan/Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone 35N system)? This PCRS covers parts of Northeast Africa - including areas of Sudan between 24째E and 30째E. Darfur, Sudan is located at approximately 13째N, 25째E, which thus places most of it in UTM Zone 35N. Since EPSG:20135 is measured in meters, I will convert each measurement into miles when creating the union buffers.# Note: All code, insights shared, and methodological notes in this document and other documents in this portfolio ARE NOT open source and MUST be cited.

#### The first visual compares attack and fatality levels within 50 mi radius union buffers around the West Darfur UN bases in Forobaranga and Habila that were closed in 2017 to 2016 levels. Visually, 2017 appears to show almost the same number of attacks compared to 2016. But my calculations reveal 30 attacks in 2016 compared to 27 in 2017, and 24 fatalities in 2016 compared to only 11 in 2017. Thus, civilian fatalities decreased by 54% after the base closures, suggesting that despite fewer UN troops the closure of these bases did not adversely affect civilian security in the area near the bases in the short term.

#### In the maps below, I compare violence levels within 50 mi of the 2 West Darfur UN bases closed in 2018 to 2017 levels. Visually, there appears to be a reduction in civilian attacks but an increase in fatalities. Indeed, my calculations show 44 attacks and 21 fatalities in 2017 near these bases, while only 25 attacks in 2018 (a 43% decrease) as fatalities rose to 31 (a 48% increase). Therefore, the immediate impact of the 2018 base closures on civilian security was more ambiguous compared to the 2017 withdrawals.

#### In the third pair of maps (Darfur in 2018 vs. 2019), when comparing the 50 mi radius buffer around the UN base in Habila that was withdrawn in 2019, it visually appears there was an increase in both attacks and fatalities from 2018 to 2019. Indeed, my calculations show that while there were 13 attacks and 24 killings in 2018, attacks increased to 19 (a 46% increase) and fatalities increased to 44 (an 83% increase) in 2019.

#### The table below shows calculations of civilian attacks and fatalities from 2016 - 2021 within 50 mi of the UN bases closed from 2017-2019. Notably, violence was highest in areas around the bases closed in 2018 and lowest around those closed in 2017 for most of these years; the 2018 closure areas were clearly already violence-prone before their bases were closed.

<br>

#### Still, in 2019, violence increased in areas around the bases closed in 2018 and 2019, and violence increased in 2021 in areas around bases closed in 2017, 2018, and 2019. E.g., in the year 2021, the 2017 closure areas saw 15 attacks and 46 fatalities (44% decrease in attacks, 318% increase in fatalities compared to the year 2017), the 2018 closure areas had 53 attacks and 133 fatalities (112% increase in attacks, 329% increase in fatalities compared to the year 2018), and the 2019 closure areas experienced 41 attacks and 124 fatalities (116% increase in attacks, 182% increase in fatalities compared to the year 2019).

<br>

#### As theorized in Visual 5, we can plainly see that in 2019 and 2021 in West Darfur, areas around closed UN bases showed high civilian fatality rates compared to the number of attacks. In 2019, areas with bases closed in 2018 had 23 attacks and 67 fatalities (2.91 fatalities per attack), and the area around the base closed in 2019 saw 19 attacks and 44 fatalities (2.32 fatalities per attack). In 2021, areas where UN bases closed in 2017, 2018, and 2019 experienced rates of 3.07, 2.51, and 3.02 fatalities per attack, respectively. Except for the year 2018 around the base later closed in 2019, there are no other cases in the years analyzed which approach 2 or more fatalities per attack.

# Below is the code for a red cell-scaled table in which the degree of redness in each cell depends on how large or small the integer values are in comparison to all of the other integers in the table. The value of having this type of table is that it quickly helps the reader understand trends by seeing which cells, columns, and/or rows are most important to look at. The font color is white for cell values > the 8th decile, and black otherwise. Through trial and error, I found that using such a high threshold helped the integer values inside the cells with both the darker as well as lighter shades of red to be clearly readable. A lower threshold will result in difficulty reading some integer values.

#### The spikes in 2019 and 2021 fatalities in West Darfur, while not conclusively linked to the UN base and troop withdrawals from 2017 to 2019, are likely related. Human Rights Watch in 2021 attributed the surge in violence to a security vacuum from UN withdrawals, [a decline in human rights monitoring, the Sudanese authorities' failure to protect civilians or provide justice for current and past abuses](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/12/15/sudan-new-wave-attacks-darfur), [inter-militia violence, and attacks by Arab militias (sometimes with the Sudanese Government's Rapid Support Forces) against non-Arab communities](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/26/violence-west-darfur). The UN also attributed the spike in violence to [unresolved ethnic and tribal tensions and Sudanese authorities' inadequate civilian protection following UNAMID's departure](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/01/1082722).

#### Next, in Visual 8 I will create similar maps to the ones shown here (but with respect to South Darfur).

```{r echo=TRUE}

# Get the current page number from the file name
current_page <- as.numeric(str_extract(knitr::current_input(), "\\d+"))

# Set the total number of pages
total_pages <- 9

# Generate the URLs for the previous and next pages
previous_page <- ifelse(current_page > 1, paste0("visual_", current_page - 1, "-darfur_violence-code_included.html"), NA)
next_page <- ifelse(current_page < total_pages, paste0("visual_", current_page + 1, "-darfur_violence-code_included.html"), NA)


```

<ul class="pager">
  <li><a href="`r previous_page`">Previous Page</a></li>
  <li><a href="`r next_page`">Next Page</a></li>
</ul>
